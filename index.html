<h1> About The UBNI Program</h1>
<p> The [Universal Basic Needs Income] program is derived from the concepts of UBI Universal Basic Income. This Card will provide $1000 monthly for 12 months to people at the federal poverty level. Which people can reapply easily by updating the system with their current work wages. It is designed to combat the naive thresholds of the programs like food stamps(EBT) and is meant to raise the baseline of the poverty level to a more hopeful line. After a certain limit the user loses their benefits which can stockpile on their already thin margins of savings and monthly bills to pay. High cost of living, Unexpected Car Maintenance, insufficient wages. On  top of that the virus has completely raised the economic difficulties higher than before. With business being closed down or half opened, work hours decreased. Combined with the fact the owning a home seems like an actual dream now. The savings vault is becoming impossibly to fill.

<h1> Why UBNI instead of UBI?

</h1>
<p>UBNI is a lot more functional than UBI because it mind you while it does have a certain threshold and the individual must meet there is a reason for that.

    If people with problems say with severe drugs,alcohol, smoking problems gets ahold of $1000?
    
    If people with gang/extremists/terrorist gets ahold of $1000?
    
    and then comes the BASIC NEEDS.
    
    Food Water and Shelter. Medications.
    
    Are the essentials. 
    
    Of course UBI might reduce bureaucratic processes.
    
    But UBNI doesn’t have to be another horribly made government website with long lines to wait or poor customer service. it can be up to date with technology making the processes much less of a headache.
    
    When you hire the right person for the job.</p>
